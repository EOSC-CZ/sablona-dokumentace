## Organization of the data and how to navigate it

National Metadata Directory contains information on research data related to Czech research in all science fields and disciplines. It covers datasets from natural sciences and engineering as well as from social sciences and humanities. It's search index concentrates metadata on datasets originating from source repositories. Metadata are description records on datasets, but not the data files, which you can access in the source repository by the link provided for each record. 

Here you will find how to search records, find what is the original repository of a dataset and how to go there for dataset files and possibly more detailed information or citation. 

National Metadata Directory focuses on datasets as a form of research data and does not contain records of scientific articles and scientific texts, which can be found in the document part of the National Repository.
