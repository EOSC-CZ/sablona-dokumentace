# National Metadata Directory

## Repository mission statement

**What is the National Metadata Directory? **

A central point and search gateway for scientific datasets from Czech research. It contains information on research data of all disciplines, from natural sciences and engineering as well as social sciences and humanities. In one place, you can search scientific repositories here at once using basic metadata and navigate to the original discipline-specific repository to access the dataset. The source repository may also offer searches by more detailed criteria or other specialised functionalities. In digital science, organising data into repositories is an important step towards higher quality research and international collaboration. For the most part, dataset files are provided on an open access basis, but some may be restricted for reasons of rights protection, commercial interest or protection of sensitive data. 

**What are datasets? **

Scientific knowledge and published scientific texts are generally based on measured data or statistical data on which they base their claims. Datasets are those data sets that complement scientific publications and are used to prove or verify their results. Sometimes they are also data from scientific instruments and equipment or organized collections of digital objects that are provided to other research organizations for subsequent analysis and research or for applications in the public sphere. 

The National Metadata Directory concentrates metadata on datasets mainly from the [National Repository Platform](https://docs.nrp.eosc.cz/en/docs/overview) repositories and selected international repositories with Czech participation. However, it does not contain records of scientific articles and scientific texts, which can be found in the document part of the National Repository.

National Metadata Directory is operated on the [NRP infrastructure](https://docs.nrp.eosc.cz/) by [CESNET z.s.p.o.](https://www.cesnet.cz/en) under the scope of [EOSC-CZ project](https://www.eosc.cz/en/projects/european-open-science-cloud-czech-republic-ips-eosc-cz). CESNET association delivers advanced ICT services for science, research, and education. It's members include public universities and the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. As pioneers of the first academic networks CESNET ensures secure access and provides robust environments for data storage, high-performance computing, and team collaboration. 

**Type of repository:** National repository system directory.

**Scope of the repository:** Czech Republic national and international with czech science participation.
