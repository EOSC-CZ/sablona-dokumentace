# Collection policy

National Metadata Directory aggregates metadata records of scientific datasets from Czech research. It contains information on research data of all disciplines, from natural sciences and engineering as well as social sciences and humanities. 

The National Metadata Directory concentrates metadata on datasets mainly from the [National Repository Platform](https://docs.nrp.eosc.cz/en/docs/overview) repositories and selected international repositories with Czech participation. However, it does not contain records of scientific articles and scientific texts, which can be found in the document part of the National Repository.

## Overview of current data sources

Current data sources: National Metadata Directory currrently harvests from three data sources, each comprising datasets from multiple institutions.

- National Repository Platform Catch-all Data Repository (all records in OAI endpoint)

- LINDAT/CLARIN Repository (all records in OAI endpoint)

- Zenodo (selection of organizations and resource types covering datasets)

### Institutions represented

There are datasets from multiple institutions in each of the above data sources. The LINDAT Repository contains datasets mainly from UFAL and other organisations, directly submitted into LINDAT, i.e. primary records (Repository), not harvested by LINDAT from third party repositories (Catalog).

The datasets from Zenodo are selected from the datasets of VŠCHT, ČVUT, ZČU, UPOL and UTB universities, based on different variants of the institution name. Currently, the exact affiliation of records to an institution is not accurate unless the record publisher is filled in correctly. Records are in English without mapping to any Czech equivalents.
